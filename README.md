# Statisical-Data-Analysis-using-R
A Comprehensive Approach for the Analysis of an Automobile Data in R using Graphical and Statistical methods

# Introduction
Data Analysis also known as Knowledge discovery from Data (KDD) refers to extracting knowledge from large amounts of data. Knowledge discovery as a process consists of an iterative sequence of seven steps namely data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, data analysis/data dredging/data mining, pattern evaluation and knowledge representation. The first four steps are different forms of data processing, where data are prepared for analysis. The data analysis step is an essential process where intelligent statistical methods are applied in order to extract data patterns (Kamber et. al. 2012).

In this report, an automobile dataset called cars93 / 93 cars is analysed comprehensively/holistically. The cars93 dataset contains information on 93 new cars for the 1993 model year. Measures given include price, mpg ratings, engine size, body size, and indicators of features. The data set contains missing values denoted by * (Lock 1993).

The remainder of this report is structured as follows: In Section 2, we explained the process of Data Importation. In Section 3, we investigated the data characteristics and, in Section 4, we present our research questions and method used for analysis. Section 5 includes further analysis carried out as defined in the Pedagogical Uses of the dataset. Section 6 rounds off the report and presents future research directions. The report includes an appendix section that houses all statistical tables used and source code of the report.

# Research Questions and Methods of Analysis
Upon proper organization and understanding of the data, deep insights were gained from the data using exploratory data analysis. Hence, we posed the following research questions and provided justification for the selected statistical methods/models used to provide answers to the questions.
  * Research Question #1: Are cars fuel consumption rate affected by their horsepower value? What is the correlation between MPG and HorsePower? Is it significantly different from zero?
  * Research Question #2: Does a car RPM have a great influence on its PRICE?
  * Research Question #3: Are Car types dependent on Drive Train Type.
  
In addition, I carried out further Data Analysis in section 5 as described by Lock (1993)
