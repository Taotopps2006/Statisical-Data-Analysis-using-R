A Comprehensive Approach for the Analysis of an Automobile Data in R using Graphical and Statistical methods

# Introduction
Data Analysis also known as Knowledge discovery from Data (KDD) refers to extracting knowledge from large amounts of data. Knowledge discovery as a process consists of an iterative sequence of seven steps namely data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation, data analysis/data dredging/data mining, pattern evaluation and knowledge representation. The first four steps are different forms of data processing, where data are prepared for analysis. The data analysis step is an essential process where intelligent statistical methods are applied in order to extract data patterns (Kamber et. al. 2012).

In this report, an automobile dataset called cars93 / 93 cars is analysed comprehensively/holistically. The cars93 dataset contains information on 93 new cars for the 1993 model year. Measures given include price, mpg ratings, engine size, body size, and indicators of features. The data set contains missing values denoted by * (Lock 1993).
